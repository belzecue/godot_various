## Sexy Stupid State Machine

As seen on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/rfzwom/sexystupid_state_machine_in_8_lines/).  Originally an 8-line solution for a quick and dirty finite state machine pattern built on the magic of setget. [Now expanded](https://github.com/belzecue/godot_various/blob/main/SSSM.gd) into its own base class to be more useful and modular.
